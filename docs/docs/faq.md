### Where can I run these kernels?

Kernels built by this project are for use on Noteable. While there may be other
platforms these kernels _can_ run on, it isn't guaranteed, recommended, or supported

### When will language XXX be available?

We welcome contributions to fix issues with existing kernels, as well as inserting new languages!
Head over to the Contributor Guide, discuss your plan and implementation with maintainers, and once
changes are accepted, those kernels are available for use shortly after

### I need different version of an installed library?

All the packages in these kernels is verified and tested by the team at Noteable. Updates to libraries,
including security patches, are adopted once they're accepted as valid.

If you have a dependency conflict with a package you're installing, you can open an issue
discussing it with maintainers.
