title: Using your Kernel
---

Currently, kernels are only usable on Noteable if they are built by [noteable-io/kernels](https://github.com/noteable-io/kernels). We don't currently support using custom images built by external systems.

When support for this changes, we'll let you know!

For changes to kernels in this repository to become available on Noteable, they must be merged and tested internally. Once validated,
they'll be deployed during our regular release schedule
