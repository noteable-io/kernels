### Clone the project

To get started, you'll need to clone the `noteable-io/kernels` project from Github.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:noteable-io/kernels
cd kernels
```

### Requirements

In order to build the various kernels provided at Noteable, you'll need a few system tools.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)

Ensure the following commands return successfully before continuing

```shell
docker info
task -h
```

### Naming Conventions

All of the kernels generated by this project are named using the following format:

```
ghcr.io/noteable-io/kernel(-gpu)-${language-(version)}-$(identifier)
```
- Language: The runtime language of the kernel (Python, r, Rust, etc)
- Version: The installed version of the above language
- Identifier: (Optional) Human readable classifier for the image (datascience, noteable)
- GPU: If the build is for GPU enabled kernels, it begins with `kernel-gpu`, rather than `kernel`

For example:
- R base kernel (4.3.0): `ghcr.io/noteable-io/kernel-r-4.3.0`
- GPU enabled Python 3.10 Datascience kernel: `ghcr.io/noteable-io/kernel-gpu-python-3.10-datascience`
