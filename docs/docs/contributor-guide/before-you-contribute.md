Before beginning to contribute to Noteable kernels, please take some time and read through the documentation. Once you're
comfortable with the tooling and structure, there are a few prerequisites before a pull request can be opened
and reviewed

### Issue Tracking

Before addressing any issues, or possibly creating a new kernel image, discussion must occur on an issue first. If
there isn't an open issue regarding your change, feel free to create one to start a conversation with the project
maintainers. Since these kernels run on the Noteable platform, certain decisions around languages, supported versions,
and other topics must be made before changes can be made.

### Signed Commits

All commits to the `noteable-io/kernels` repository must be signed. If you don't have commit signing setup
on your workstation, please follow [Signing Commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)
to do so.


All other style and usage guidelines covered in this documentation apply to Pull Requests by all contributors, both
external and internal.
